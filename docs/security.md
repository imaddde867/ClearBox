## GDPR Compliance
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect necessary user data.
- **User Rights:** Provide users with mechanisms to access, export, or delete their data.
- **Privacy Policy:** Clearly document how user data is processed and stored.

## Logging & Monitoring
- **Audit Logs:** Maintain logs for key actions and data access.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Use tools to monitor system performance and detect potential security breaches.
